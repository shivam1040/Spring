MVC-model view controller

spring mvc sub module is used to build a web application
spring mvc is build on top of servlet api
servlet api doesn't use mvc architecture so spring mvc provides this feature

in MVC: Model is data, view is presentation layer, controller(interface b/w model and view) is who control(servlet in this case)

SpringMVc provides loose coupling as compared to servlet jsp implementation

Springmvc has all feaures of spring core(ioc, autowiring, dependency injection)

MVC Design pattern: it's basically a way to oraganize and keep the code, this automatically maintains a standard

data can be moved between view and controller by model and modelAndView

pathvariable annotation is used to bind method parameter to uri tempelate'

springinterceptor is same as filter in servlet
