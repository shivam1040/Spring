Spring propogation gives ability to the developer to define how business methods should behave/encapsulated in terms of logical and physical transaction
Methods from distinct spring beans may be executed in same transaction scope or may expand acrosss multiple nested transaction

local transaction management-single database
two phase/distributed transaction management-multiple database

in spring we can implement transactions in two ways, one is programmatic way and another is declarative way

programmatic way give greater control to user in setting up the transaction boundaries, possible to set boundaries to part of code, however transaction management codes need to be inserted into program logic which is very intrusive

declarative type is annotation type transaction management

JTATransactionManager class can be used for multiple DB transaction management

use defaultTransaction definition for implementing I of transaction ACID property
